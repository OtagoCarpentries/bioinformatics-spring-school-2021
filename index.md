## About

Bioinformatics Spring School 2021 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz) and the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI)](https://www.nesi.org.nz). 

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by [The Carpentries](https://www.carpentries.org)), covering example workflows of DNA variant calling, genotyping by sequencing (GBS), RNAseq analysis, and environmental DNA (eDNA).

This event is organised by:

- Alana Alexander
- Mik Black
- Murray Cadzow
- Hugh Cross
- Ludovic Dutoit
- Ngoni Faya

### When and where?

- 9:30 - 16:30, 22 November - 26 November 2021
- University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand

This is an in-person event.

### Cost?

This event will only cost your time (there isn't a $ charge).

### Registration

Registration will be opening soon

### Is this for me?

This event is designed to give researchers (including students - 4th year and above) the opportunity to learn about and practice some bioinformatic skills. We'll be covering bioinformatic workflows such as:

- DNA variant calling from next generation sequence data
- Genotype-by-Sequencing analysis (i.e. RAD-Sequencing)
- RNA-sequencing differential expression analysis
- Environmental DNA analysis

along with computational topics such as:

- Introduction to the Unix commandline (Bash)
- Introduction to R
- Introduction to working in a high performance computing environment (provided by NeSI)
- Introduction to version control using git

This week long event is designed to be an immersive experience so **we ask that you commit to the entire week.** We have chosen to interleave the computational topics throughout the week so that we can build on them throughout the entire week, so this ensures participants have the key knowledge at the right time.

The underlying workshop content is extremely similar to previous workshops run by Genomics Aotearoa so if you've already attended the Genomic Data Carpentry and RNAseq workshops you will have already covered the majority of the content.
